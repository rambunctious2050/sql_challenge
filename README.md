# sql_challenge

## In this activity, I created a relational database of employee data at a company and then extracted the subset of data to answer questions about the employees. 

### First, I mapped out the tables using an ERD. The data was stored in a set of .csv files.

### Next, I created the necessary tables in SQL

### Finally, I answered questions about the employees by analyzing the data in SQL
